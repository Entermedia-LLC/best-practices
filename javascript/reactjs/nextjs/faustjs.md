The purpose of this document is to help guide you through working with a potential project using the JavaScript library, [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/). Outside of the official [Faust.js documentation](https://faustjs.org/docs), you should find here personalized recommendations for using the library based on the types of projects we typically see at Entermedia. We have broken these recommendations out into common elements we tend to interact with often in client work. If something you’re looking for isn’t represented you can either submit a pull request to this repository or refer to the official documentation.
