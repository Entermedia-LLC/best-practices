Entermedia uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, for all JS projects.

## Coding Standards

- Avoid inlining type declarations
- Use `interface` over `type` so that consumers can extend the properties
- Never use `any` as a type definition, see [TypeScript: Stop Using 'any', There's a Type For That](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/typescript-stop-using-any-there-s-a-type-for-that) for more information.
