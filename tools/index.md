# Tools & Resources

The following are tools & resources we use at Entermedia. This list will grow and change over time and is not meant to be comprehensive. Generally, we encourage or require these tools to be used in favor of other ones. Rules governing tools to be used and packaged with a client site will be much stricter than those used on internal projects.

- [Leasot](https://github.com/pgilad/leasot) - A command line tool to intelligently parse and output TODOs and FIXMEs from comments in your files. It allows you to easily extract, collect, and report TODOs and FIXMEs in your code using regex in order to extract your todos from comments.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - An an opinionated code formatter with [editor integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html). **Recommend on all projects.**

## Accessibility Testing

We use a variety of tools to test our sites for accessibility issues. WebAim has some great resources on [how to evaluate sites](http://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/) with a screen reader.

- Using [VoiceOver](http://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/)
- Using [NVDA](http://webaim.org/articles/nvda/)
- Using [JAWS](http://webaim.org/articles/jaws/)

We’re also a fan of a few browser tools that lend us a hand when it comes to testing areas like color contrast, heading hierarchy, and ARIA application.

- [Headings Map for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headingsmap/flbjommegcjonpdmenkdiocclhjacmbi?hl=es) or [Headings Map for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/headingsmap/) - A browser extension that allows you to see the heading structure of a webpage.
- [The Visual ARIA Bookmarklet](http://whatsock.com/training/matrices/visual-aria.htm) - A bookmarklet that can be run on a webpage and color codes ARIA roles.
- [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) - A toolkit from WebAIM, that also has an extension for Chrome/Firefox. It evaluates a webpage and returns accessibility errors.
- [Accessibility Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb) - A Chrome extension that adds an “Audit” tab in Chrome’s developer tools that can scan a webpage for accessibility issues.
- [Tota11y](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) - A visualization toolkit that can be used as a bookmarklet, and reveals accessibility errors on a webpage.
- [Contrast Ratio](https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/) - A color contrast tool to compare two colors against levels of conformance and see if they pass.
- [Tanagaru Contrast Finder](http://contrast-finder.tanaguru.com/?lang=en) - Another color contrast tool that tests colors against the levels of conformance, but also provides you with alternatives should your provided colors fail.
